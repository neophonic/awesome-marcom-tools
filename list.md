# awesome-marcom-tools
List of marcom tools and resources (both opensource and proprietary) I love to use or do recommend.

## Research Tools

### [Infranodus](https://github.com/noduslabs/infranodus)
Pretty useful service for text analysis. You can brainstorm, import data sets or explore public documents and topic discourse using Infranodus. Available on GitHub & as a paid SaaS. 

## Content Management Systems

### [Directus](https://github.com/directus)
I love Directus because of its flexibility & ability to help us generate massive amounts of semi-customized landing pages and content elements across the website.

## Information Management

### [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
